## Creating the  Package

Issue the command
```
sudo ./buildPackage.sh
```
to build the temporary `build` folder, containing `/Library/TeX`.

## Building TeXDist

Open `TeXDistBuild.pmdoc`, the Packagemaker project file, using the GUI interface.

* Click the top item on the left. The right side will change to a view with three tabs. First select the Configuration tab. Edit so

    | Option                  | Value |
    | ---                     | --- |
    | **Title**               | TeXDist |
    | **User Sees**           | Easy Install Only |
    | **Install Destination** | System volume |
    | **Certificate**         | Leave this blank. (You might think that putting a certificate name here would correctly sign the package, but experiments show that it does not. The package needs to be signed after it is constructed.) |
    | **Description**         | *empty* |

* The Requirements and Actions tab entries for the top item can be left blank
* Click the entry TeXDist in the Contents section on the left. The right side will change to a view with two tabs.
  Select the Configuration tab. Edit so:

    | Option            | Value                |
    | ---               | ---                  |
    | **Choice Name**   | `TeXDist`            |
    | **Identifier**    | `choice1`            |
    | **Initial State** | Selected and Enabled |
    | **Destination**   | *leave blank*        |
    | **Tooltip**       | *leave blank*        |
    | **Description**   | *leave blank*        |

* The Requirements tab entries for this contents item can be left blank
* Open the TeXDiste  entry in the bottom left column. This item should show a `Library' directory, obtained by dragging `build/Library` to the left column. The right side will change to a view with four tabs.
  It is not necessary to edit the items under the Contents or Components tabs. The items under the Configuration tab should be edited as follows:

    | Option                           | Value |
    | ---                              | ---   |
    | **Install**                      | `build/Library` (The item on the right should have `Relative To Project` selected) |
    | **Destination**                  | `/Library` (The item on the right should have `Relative To Project` selected) |
    | **Allow custom location**        | *don't check* |
    | **Patch**                        | No patch root selected |
    | **Package Identifier**           | `org.tug.texdist2017` |
    | **Package Version**              | 1.0 |

  The items under the Scripts tab should be edited to read

    | Option                | Value |
    | ---                   | ---   |
    | **Scripts directory** | `scripts` (The item on the right should have `Relative To Project` selected) |
    | **Preinstall**        | *leave blank* |
    | **Postinstall**       | `scripts/postinstall` (The item on the right should have `Relative To Project` selected) |
